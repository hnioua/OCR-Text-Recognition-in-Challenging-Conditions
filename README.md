## üß† Project Overview
This project develops an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) solution that can detect and recognise text in difficult scenarios‚Äînoisy backgrounds, blur, and low contrast.  
It combines image-preprocessing pipelines with a comparative study of several OCR engines and deep-learning models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Image Pre-processing** ‚Äì noise reduction, deblurring, contrast enhancement, binarisation  
- **Engine Benchmarking** ‚Äì Tesseract OCR, EasyOCR, and a custom TensorFlow model  
- **Performance Metrics** ‚Äì precision, recall, and overall accuracy on degraded-image datasets

## üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Techniques

To enhance text visibility and improve OCR accuracy, the following image processing techniques are applied:

- **Grayscale Conversion** ‚Äì simplifies the image for further processing  
- **Gaussian Blur Removal** ‚Äì using filters to sharpen blurred text  
- **Noise Reduction** ‚Äì via median or bilateral filtering  
- **Contrast Enhancement** ‚Äì through histogram equalization and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)  
- **Thresholding** ‚Äì adaptive or Otsu thresholding for binarization  
- **Morphological Operations** ‚Äì dilation, erosion, and opening to clean the text area  
- **Edge Detection** ‚Äì optional use of Canny edge detector for region segmentation
